# Rust: baby steps to world domination

Some low-tech project management tooling, aka markdown with checkboxes.

Overall goal: get somewhat fluent with rust, up to a level that allows me to
understand the major differences to other programming languages and being able
to write code to some level of proficiency. This requires:

- basic syntax: 
-- [ ] functions
-- [ ] standard types
-- [ ] defining own types, structs
-- [ ] implementing traits (and roll your own)
-- [ ] collections: `Vec`, iterators, slices etc
-- [ ] higher-order functions: flatmap that shit
-- [ ] algebraic data types
-- [ ] ... (tbd)
- standard library
-- [ ] handling files
-- [ ] handling network
-- [ ] ... (tbd)
- understanding the memory concept
-- [ ] references, `&mut`, `Box`, ...
-- [ ] grasp of the ownership model
-- [ ] ... (unknown unknowns)
- eco system
-- [ ] roll your own rest API
-- [ ] dive into delta-rs, parquet, arrow
-- [ ] ballista ftw!


We start simple, and write code for everything we try.
